# Code Refactoring
This archive contains a Visual Studio solution with a web service that provides access to voucher information.
The voucher information is loaded from a file named data.json.
Your task is to complete development of this service and improve it in any way you think appropriate.

## The Challenge
* Fix all the issues with loading / building the project
* Fix all the issues with running and getting the tests green
* Incorporate IOC using the DI container that comes with .NET Core
* Appropriate unit testing coverage. (we would like to see close to 100% test coverage)
* Refactoring the code base as appropriate to:
>1. Improve the overall usability.
>2. Maintainability of the codebase.
>3. Performance.
>4. TIP: There is a controller in the project, but it is not showing in Visual Studio. I suggest you start with fixing that.

### What are we looking for?
This challenge is focused on general software engineering practices, patterns and code refactoring techniques.
Our goal is to find out how well you can write good quality and maintanable production code.
